# SecureSum: A Flower for custom secure sum strategy using SecAgg+.

## Introduction

This example shows how to use Flower to define a custom strategy that performs only secure federated summing (mentioned several times in our article), rather than using FedAvg, and does so securely through the **SecAgg+** protocol. The federated process considered here sums N-dimensional vectors randomly generated by clients. The focus is on the files **custom_strategy.py** and **aggregate.py**, where the custom strategy is defined.

For more information on Flower, we refer the reader to [Flower's webpage](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/tutorial-series-get-started-with-flower-pytorch.html).

## If not installed, install Flower as well as dependencies

To install Flower, run the following command:

```bash
pip install flwr
```
Next, install dependencies: 

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Run the federated simulation with the Simulation Engine

In the `SecureSum` directory, use `flwr run` to run a local simulation of the federated process:

```bash
flwr run .
```
